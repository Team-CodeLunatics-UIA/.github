# [Learnup](https://learnup.vercel.app/) - Effective Data Collection, Analysis, and Visualization Platform to Transform School

### Story
> We were tasked with developing a data collection, processing, and visualization platform that can improve educational institutions.
> The goal was to enhance education through data-driven insights. In the modern landscape of education, evidence-based information is crucial for progress. However, the lack of essential data, such as learning outcomes, teacher quality, infrastructure assessment, and more, presents significant challenges.
> Our team, which included individuals from Mali, Mauritius, India, and Malawi, worked on a solution to handle this issue.

### Developing the solution
Our solution revolved around developing an application to gather critical data related to schools, including infrastructure, students, teachers, and finances. Complementing this, we could employ an intelligent rule-based engine powered by AI and machine learning. This engine could analyze the data and offer tailored suggestions for improvement, ranging from remedial interventions to identifying training needs for teachers. For now, it is still work in progress.

### Dashboard
The culmination of our efforts is a dynamic dashboard that visually presents the insights, enabling educators and policymakers to make informed decisions. By showcasing the potential of AI and machine learning using a simulated dataset, we demonstrate the practicality of our solution in facilitating data-driven decision-making for educational advancements. Some key features of the dashboard:
- Dashboard web application deployed on the internet that can be used to gather, analyze, and visualize information related to some important data indicators such as student enrollment and performance, teacher quality, infrastructure, etc to support school transformation.
- To meet the needs at various levels of education, the suggested system operated in three hierarchical user views (Teachers, Schools, and Districts). Although we had plans to go for levels till the Central government, due to time and resource constraints we had to limit ourselves to three levels for now.
- The system also included several embedded geographic map-views that displayed various information about these crucial indicators for better visualization, like an enrollment rate heatmap, the population density of a region in proportion to the number of nearby schools, the dropout rate's color-coded distribution, etc. These features not only helped to know the distance traveled by students to school in an area but also helped to identify the most critical areas for development that the authorities can focus on.
- It was also suggested to use blockchain technology for the secure distribution of funds.

This advancement can assist all parties, including the government and educational institutions, in making informed decisions based on evidence-based data.
In summary, our project addresses data deficiencies in education and provides a comprehensive framework for progress. Through evidence-based programming and insightful analytics, we pave the way for informed decision-making, ultimately shaping the future of education.

This project was selected and finalized as the winning project by the evaluators and we were awarded by the **Vice-President of India (Shri Jagdeep Dhankar)** and the **Minister of Education of India (Shri Dharmendra Pradhan)** for the UNESCO India Africa Hackathon 2022.
