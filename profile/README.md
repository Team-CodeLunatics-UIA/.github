# [Learnup](https://learnup.vercel.app/) - Effective Data Collection, Analysis, and Visualization Platform to Transform School

### Story
> We were tasked with developing a data collection, processing, and visualization platform that can improve educational institutions.
> The goal was to enhance education through data-driven insights. In the modern landscape of education, evidence-based information is crucial for progress. However, the lack of essential data, such as learning outcomes, teacher quality, infrastructure assessment, and more, presents significant challenges.
> Our team, which included individuals from Mali, Mauritius, India, and Malawi, worked on a solution to handle this issue.

### Developing the solution
Our solution revolved around developing an application to gather critical data related to schools, including infrastructure, students, teachers, and finances. Complementing this, we could employ an intelligent rule-based engine powered by AI and machine learning. This engine could analyze the data and offer tailored suggestions for improvement, ranging from remedial interventions to identifying training needs for teachers. For now, it is still a work in progress.

### Dashboard
The culmination of our efforts is a dynamic dashboard that visually presents the insights, enabling educators and policymakers to make informed decisions. By showcasing the potential of AI and machine learning using a simulated dataset, we demonstrate the practicality of our solution in facilitating data-driven decision-making for educational advancements. Some key features of the dashboard:
- **Unified Data Ecosystem**: Our singular platform serves as a comprehensive hub for the aggregation, analysis, and visualization of critical data indicators. Ranging from student enrollment and performance to teacher quality and infrastructure, this integrated solution supports school transformation through actionable insights.
- **Multi-Tiered User Hierarchy**: The proposed system accommodates diverse educational requirements through its three-tiered user views: Teachers, Schools, and Districts. While our initial plan is to extend these levels till the Central government, resource and time limitations have temporarily confined us to these three tiers.
- **Enhanced Visualization with Embedded Geographic Maps**: Our system integrates a range of embedded geographic map-views that offer comprehensive insights into vital indicators. These visualizations include a heatmap illustrating enrollment rates, the proportional population density surrounding schools, color-coded distributions of dropout rates, and more. These dynamic features serve a dual purpose: not only do they provide visibility into student commuting distances, but they also pinpoint critical developmental areas for targeted attention by authorities.
- **Accessible Round the Clock, Anywhere**: Our platform is seamlessly accessible online, ensuring convenient usage from any location and at any time.
- **Future Scope**: We envision the incorporation of blockchain technology for ensuring secure fund distribution. This innovation holds the potential to elevate the security and transparency of fund allocation processes.

This advancement can assist all parties, including the government and educational institutions, in making informed decisions based on evidence-based data.
In summary, our project addresses data deficiencies in education and provides a comprehensive framework for progress. Through evidence-based programming and insightful analytics, we pave the way for informed decision-making, ultimately shaping the future of education.

This project was selected and finalized as the winning project by the evaluators and we were awarded by the **Vice-President of India (Shri Jagdeep Dhankar)** and the **Minister of Education of India (Shri Dharmendra Pradhan)** for the UNESCO India Africa Hackathon 2022.
